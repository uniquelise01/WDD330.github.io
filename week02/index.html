        <ul>
            <li>I wasn't sure what the difference between <i>const, let,</i> and <i>var</i> was in js, so I looked it up. When you make a <i>var</i> within a function, it can only be called in that function. However, if you declare it outside of a function, it can be used anywhere. <i>Var</i> can also be redefined at any point and not cause an error.<br><br><i>Let</i> is the preferred declaration for variables. It is block scoped, which means you can redefine it in a different block sucessfully, but if you call it outside of that redefined block, it will log the original declared value. In a sense, two <i>let</i>s labled the same in different blocks are considered different variables.<br><br><i>Const,</i> like <i>let,</i> can only be called within its own block, and they can't ever be redefined or re-declared. Obviously each one can be useful for different reasons.</li><br>
            <li>Local scope vs global scope: Global scope variables are declared outside of a block and can be used anywhere in the code. Local scope variables are declared within a block and usually can only be used within that block.</li>
        </ul>
