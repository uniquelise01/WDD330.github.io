        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I wasn't sure what the difference between <i>const, let,</i> and <i>var</i> was in js, so I looked it up. When you make a <i>var</i> within a function, it can only be called in that function. However, if you declare it outside of a function, it can be used anywhere. <i>Var</i> can also be redefined at any point and not cause an error.<br><br><i>Let</i> is the preferred declaration for variables. It is block scoped, which means you can redefine it in a different block sucessfully, but if you call it outside of that redefined block, it will log the original declared value. In a sense, two <i>let</i>s labled the same in different blocks are considered different variables.<br><br><i>Const,</i> like <i>let,</i> can only be called within its own block, and they can't ever be redefined or re-declared. However, if you declare a <i>const</i> with code such as const d = value: 4, you can later change the value by going d.value = 8.</li><br>
            <li>Local scope vs global scope: Global scope variables are declared outside of a block and can be used anywhere in the code. Local scope variables are declared within a block and usually can only be used within that block. Variables defined without <i>let</i> or <i>const</i> are automatically global scope.</li>
            <li>You can use backslashes (\) to avoid the function associated with certain symbols. For example, if you had string 'It's fun', your single quotes would only identify 'It' as the string. However, if you added this backslash: 'It\'s fun', it automatically skips over that quote mark. If you actually want to write a backslash, you'll need to backslash it with an additional backslash! ex: "This is the backslash: \\".</li>
            <li>There are some cool things you can do with strings, like discover the length (name.length), change everything name.toUpperCase or name.toLowerCase, or discover which character is at which point (name.charAt(1)). REMEMBER that there is a position 0 in javascript. Position 1 is the second character. There are plenty other string methods.</li>
            <li>I learned that through template literals, you can use the backtick character (`) instead of the quote mark to note strings. This makes it easier to add quotation marks in your strings. It also eliminates the need for + signs between strings and variables you want to insert into your code. You use curly brackets and $ instead, ex: `Hello ${name}!`</li>
            <li>I also discovered the difference between parseInt and parseFloat. ParseInt will convert a string into an integer, and return NaN if there is no number. ParseFloat will convert a string into a "floating" number, which is usually a decimal.</li>
            <li>Some useful number methods are toFixed(), where you can round something to (x) number of decimals; and toPrecision(), which rounds a number to a significant amount of figures (so large numbers go to exponential notation, etc).</li>
        </ul>
