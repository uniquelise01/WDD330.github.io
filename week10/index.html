        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Form validation comes in forms of "This field is required" or "Please enter a valid email address", etc. There's both client-side and server-side validation. You can use built-in form validation or javascript validation.</li>
            <li>Some examples of built-in form validation is "required," "minlength," "maxlength," and "type." You can also style valid and invalid entries by using input:valid {} or input:invalid {}.</li>
            <li>There's a lot more flexibility with javascript validation. Use properties like "tooLong," "tooShort," "typeMismatch," "valid," or "valueMissing." You can also use methods like checkValidity(), preventDefault(), setCustomValidity(). You can also make customized error messages.</li>
        </ul>
