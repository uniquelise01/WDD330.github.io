        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Errors happen when something goes wrong in the program, like a system or programming error. Exceptions are errors that trigger a response that allow the program to deal with the error, like having an "undefined" method pop up when a non-existant function is called. Exceptions create an error object that you can then address in your code. Warnings are like errors that don't stop the code from running, but are still problematic.</li>
            <li>You can add the line <i>'use strict';</i> to the beginning of your javascript file and it will be more strict about what code you use. It will pop up errors if you write sloppy code.</li>
            <li>You can use the <i>throw</i> statement to throw exceptions.</li>
            <li>You can use try, catch, and finally blocks that will bypass errors or exceptions.</li>
            <li>Another method of debugging code is to write tests <i>before</i> you write your code, and then write your code to pass the tests. That way you know for sure from the start if your code works.</li>
        </ul>
