        <ul>
            <li>If an app isn't designed to store info, that info will be lost when the app is closed.</li>
            <li>To store input information, you use the localStorage javascript code to save key-value pairs. So as long as you have the key, you can find the value.</li>
            <li>As far as my research can tell, the localStorage code saves the information on an SQLite file and keeps it there until it is cleared using other code.</li>
            <li>Some of the code you can use for localStorage is setItem(), getItem(), removeItem(), and clear(), among several others. It will take me a little bit of practice to master it!</li>
            <li>Some of my highlights from the sitepoint video to improve user experience were to design for mobile first, focus on usefulness and smooth experience, reduce images to increase speed, optimize files, make processes as easy as possible for the user, and don't use pop-up adds!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I doubt localStorage is a long-term solution to data storage, especially on a large scale. When would using localStorage be appropriate?</li>
