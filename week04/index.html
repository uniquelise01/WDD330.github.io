        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When creating forms, the most common types of form tags are &lt;input&gt;, (which can be text, password, radio buttons, etc) &lt;select&gt;, (which is for drop-down lists) &lt;textarea&gt;, and &lt;button&gt;.</li>
            <li>Most of what I learned this week was how to apply principles in old chapters to things I was more familiar with, like forms and common html.</li>
            <li>There are three characteristics of object-oriented programing: Encapsulation means only the essential functionalities are shows to the user, and all the methods etc are hidden inside the object programming. Polymorphism is the ability to mix up what goes into the object programming with the same resultâ€”or the same process can be used for different objects. And lastly, OOPs must have inheritance, meaning it can be updated while keeping the same previous functionality.</li>
            <li>You can use the <i>get()</i> and <i>set()</i> methods to control how a property is set and what value is returned. So you can redefine a value both ways.</li>
            <li>You can use the <i>mixin()</i> function to combine mutliple arrays, objects, functions, etc, without creating an inheritance chain.</li>
            <li>The value of <i>this</i> doesn't stay consistent if you nest functions, so you can solve that by using <i>that = this</i> and/or <i>bind(this)</i> as a method in your functions.</li>
            <li>Modular javascript is something like creating seperate js files for specific purposes (ex: you create a file for all Ajax projects and reference it when needed). You can import one modular js into another js file. You would do so like this: <i>import {functionName, otherFunctionName} from './stats.js';</i> although there are several ways you can import different types of js.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Why do we add 'false' at the end of many (if not all) event listeners?</li>
            <li>A lot of this weeks reading went over my head. What is most important and used most frequently in javascript?</li>
            <li>I still don't understand the difference between <i>this</i> and <i>that</i> and how to use them together.</li>
