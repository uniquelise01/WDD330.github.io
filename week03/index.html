        <ul>
            <li>To my understanding, object literals are objects that contain multiple values and/or functions. You can also create nested objects.</li>
            <li>It's interesting that changes to a variable assigned to an already-existing object will change bothe the object and the new variable. However, if you use primitive values, like letters, it won't do the same thing.</li>
            <li>The <i>this</i> method can sometimes confuse me, but the more I study it, the more it just seems like <i>this</i> is just referencing the original object. I could be wrong, but sometimes things are simpler than they seem.</li>
            <li>To avoid repeating object, object literal, or function names, try using name spacing: put all of your functions and objects inside the same object literal, like <i>const myMaths = {}</i>. Then, when called, just use <i>myMaths.square(x)</i>, etc.</li>
            <li>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a format we use to configure and serialize data, in a similar format as object literals. However, in JSON, property names need to be in double-quotes and functions are not permitted. To turn JSON into JS, use <i>.parse()</i>. To convert JS into JSON, use <i>.stringify()</i>.</li>
            <li>There are several very useful math objects in JS. I'll put them in a table:</li>

            <li>You can use regular expressions as a kind of "Find and replace" code. Ex: <i>const pattern = new RegExp('[a-zA-Z]+ing');</i> will return true if a word has 'ing' at the end of it.</li>
            <li>I hadn't realized I'd been using the Document Object Model (DOM) in javascript already! I've only ever tried <i>getElementById()</i> though, and there are a few others: <i>getElementsByTagNames('li')</i> and <i>getElementsByClassName(),</i> for example. There's also <i>document.querySelector(),</i> which you can use in the same way you use css selection. So IDs would be referenced like '#bats' or classes with '.hero', etc. <i>document.querySelectorAll()</i> is used in the same way, but selects every element in the document that matches your selection.</li>
            <li>You can access and set ids, classes, and other attributes using the following code: <i>.setAttribute('id', 'hero'), .getAttribute('class'), .className(), .classList.add(), .classList.remove(), .classList.contains(),</i> and <i>.classList.toggle().</i> That last one will add a class name if it doesn't exist, or remove it if it does.</li>
            <li>I knew you could add text in an html element, but I didn't know you could create new elements! I learned about cool DOM js like <i>document.createElement('li'), .createTextNode('Flash'), .appendChild(), .textContent = '',</i> and more.</li>
            <li>You can add css styling in javascript by doing this: <i>elementName.style.backgroundColor = 'blue'</i>. Notice that property names that are usually seperated by a dash in css must be converted to camelCase in js.</li>
            <li>You can use event listeners to call a function, etc when it needs to be called without keeping the rest of your code from running.</li>
            <li>There are several different events you can call using event listener: <i>click, dblclick, mouseover, mouseout, mousemove,</i> and some other ones that work for keys, like <i>keydown,</i> which goes off when the key is pressed and continues to occur if held; <i>keypress,</i> which occurs after keydown and only works for character keys and the delete key; and <i>keyup,</i> which occurs when the key is released. There are also touch events for touch screens, like <i>touchstart, touchend, touchmove, touchcenter, touchleave, touchcancel,</i> etc. <i>Click</i> also works for touch screens.</li>
            <li>Bubbling vs Capturing: bubbling lets an event fire up from one parent to the next parent element. Capturing lets an event fire on each child element until it reaches the target element. So they both essentially have the same result, with different coding.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Where does JSON come from? I still don't understand what it's used for.</li>
            <li>I'm a little overwhelmed by regular expresisons and their modifiers. Which are most commonly used? Where would you see them?</li>
            <li>Should you include touch event listeners on all of your code (when needed) to keep it mobile friendly?</li>
